I used a lot of python modules/libraries for this program. There are various codes in this respository. 
I combined all codes one by one using Abstraction.

It is advised to upload non-fire and fire dataset separately. Comment them one by one and run the codes.

I coded the sound file using winsound module of python.


For the final code refer to datsets try alarm.py

I am attaching the dataset i used here.

Note that i made two folders, one each for fire and non-fire images.
The non fire images are mostly of forest. So you can say this model as forest fire detection.

Also I have turned off that epochs training printing which comes after the code runs. To turn it on you go on Step 4:Train the model. And remove verbose variable.
